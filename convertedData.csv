"Human serum is derived from the liquid plasma component of the blood with the fibrinogens, or clotting factors, removed and is composed of small molecules such as salts, lipids, amino acids, sugars and approximately 60-80 mg of proteins/mL [1] . Serum is a readily obtainable peripheral bodily fluid from which the protein profile directly reflects the normal or disease state of the organism [2] [3] [4] . Serum is a complex mixture of ""classical"" and ""non-classical"" proteins. Classical serum proteins are involved in a number of processes including proteolysis, inhibition, binding, transport, coagulation, and immune response and are often secreted from the liver, through the intestines, and into the bloodstream [5] . ""Non-classical"" proteins are proteins that are not directly tied to any known function within the serum and often originate from cellular leakage or shedding, and may utilize the bloodstream for transportation [5] . It is generally accepted that most of the significant changes in the serum will be found in these low abundant non-classical proteins, due to the hypothesis that the presence of these proteins should reflect changes in the diseased tissue. Indeed, serum commonly contains upwards of 10,000 different proteins at any given time that are being actively produced and secreted by all cells and tissues, therefore, the proteomic profile of serum can give insight into the systemic reaction to a disease state and can serve as a pool of differentially expressed proteins [2, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Recently, the interest in characterizing the human serum proteome has increased due to the determination of disease biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis, and drug targeting; however, due to the extensive dynamic range of protein concentration within the serum, the identification of low abundance proteins suitable for biomarker determination is often masked. The 22 highly abundant proteins contained within serum constitute approximately 99% of the total serum proteins, including albumin, IgG, transferrin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, etc. and interfere with the identification of low abundance proteins in the ng/mL concentration range. The presence of these highly abundant proteins necessitates the prefractionation of serum samples prior to analysis for low abundant proteins. Due to the dynamic insight the analysis of the serum proteome can relate to a disease state, of particular interest is the identification of low abundant proteins that change in expression or abundance in response to a disease state. These low abundant proteins could potentially arise as an early diagnostic for a disease state, or a therapeutic target.","[{'start': 240, 'end': 243, 'text': '[1]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF0'}, {'start': 393, 'end': 396, 'text': '[2]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF1'}, {'start': 397, 'end': 400, 'text': '[3]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF2'}, {'start': 401, 'end': 404, 'text': '[4]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF3'}, {'start': 718, 'end': 721, 'text': '[5]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF4'}, {'start': 934, 'end': 937, 'text': '[5]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF4'}, {'start': 1505, 'end': 1508, 'text': '[2,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF1'}, {'start': 1509, 'end': 1512, 'text': '[6]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF5'}, {'start': 1513, 'end': 1516, 'text': '[7]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF6'}, {'start': 1517, 'end': 1520, 'text': '[8]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF7'}, {'start': 1521, 'end': 1524, 'text': '[9]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF8'}, {'start': 1525, 'end': 1529, 'text': '[10]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF9'}, {'start': 1530, 'end': 1534, 'text': '[11]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF10'}, {'start': 1535, 'end': 1539, 'text': '[12]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF11'}, {'start': 1540, 'end': 1544, 'text': '[13]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF12'}]",[],Background
"Serum proteomics has emerged as an integral biomarker identification and diagnostic tool, especially for infectious diseases and oncology. Recently, novel serum biomarkers have been identified for liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients as well as unique protein signatures in SARS coronavirus infections, and infant hepatitis syndrome induced by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection [14] [15] [16] . Characterization of the serum protein profile of these viral states helps provide insight into the expression changes associated with viral infection. In particular, HIV-1 infection, even at the acute phase, results in dramatic changes in both cellular and viral protein expression levels. As the HIV-1 viral tropism consists primarily of CD4+ T-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, the resulting protein changes can be seen systemically as infected cells travel throughout the body. Additionally, the nature of this viral infection supports the secretion of altered proteins into the blood and subsequently the serum due to the propensity of the virus to stimulate apoptosis of infected cells, therefore emptying cellular contents into the serum. These characteristics of HIV-1 infection suggest that the analysis of the serum of infected patients is an appropriate reflection of a patients' altered protein expression state.","[{'start': 406, 'end': 410, 'text': '[14]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF13'}, {'start': 411, 'end': 415, 'text': '[15]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF14'}, {'start': 416, 'end': 420, 'text': '[16]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF15'}]",[],Background
"Due to innate genetic and phenotypic differences in the human population, significant variability exists in the sus-ceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Amongst this diversity includes the well-studied CCR5Δ32 inherited mutation, which prevents the binding of R5-tropic HIV-1 strains to the CCR5 chemokine receptor on the surface of CD4+ Tcells, therefore preventing entry of the virus [17] . Additionally, some individuals can be infected with HIV-1, however will not progress to AIDS even in the absence of therapy. These Long Term Non-Progressors (LTNPs) are often characterized as being infected with HIV-1 but are also disease free and sustain a normal CD4 T-cell count and a low viral load. Over the past 20 years, multiple studies have been aimed at determining the reason that these individuals are able to resist disease progression. There are studies that suggest that the virus infecting these cells could be deficient in some way, for example, Nef deficient viruses and Vpr R77Q mutations are associated with LTNPs [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . A number of host factors have also been identified that may contribute to the observed resistance. LTNPs have a higher prevalence of the CCR5Δ32 allele [17, [23] [24] [25] . In addition, the presence of certain HLA genes including HLA-B27, HLA-B*5701, HLA-B*5401, and HLA-B*1507 have been linked to LTNP [26] [27] [28] however, the identified alterations do not account for all cases of LTNP. Therefore, the search for protective host factors is still an area of active investigation in hopes of obtaining information that could be of therapeutic value.","[{'start': 381, 'end': 385, 'text': '[17]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF16'}, {'start': 1022, 'end': 1026, 'text': '[18]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF17'}, {'start': 1027, 'end': 1031, 'text': '[19]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF18'}, {'start': 1032, 'end': 1036, 'text': '[20]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF19'}, {'start': 1037, 'end': 1041, 'text': '[21]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF20'}, {'start': 1042, 'end': 1046, 'text': '[22]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF21'}, {'start': 1201, 'end': 1205, 'text': '[17,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF16'}, {'start': 1206, 'end': 1210, 'text': '[23]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF22'}, {'start': 1211, 'end': 1215, 'text': '[24]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF23'}, {'start': 1216, 'end': 1220, 'text': '[25]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF24'}, {'start': 1353, 'end': 1357, 'text': '[26]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF25'}, {'start': 1358, 'end': 1362, 'text': '[27]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF26'}, {'start': 1363, 'end': 1367, 'text': '[28]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF27'}]",[],Background
"Here, we describe the detection of unique, low abundant serum proteins in latently infected HIV-1 LTNPs as compared to serum from patients undergoing HAART treatment, and those not infected with HIV-1. We attempted to characterize the underlying differences in LTNPs that contribute to the ability of these patients to combat HIV-1 infections. We have depleted 12 of the most highly abundant serum proteins from three sets of serum samples (uninfected, infected on HAART, LTNP) and identified differentially expressed proteins across the samples. In particular, we focus on the identified cellular protein p16 INK4A which is found preferentially in LTNP patient serum samples, but is not present in patients undergoing HAART treatment. In vitro viral assays and viability studies confirm the loss of viral replication upon p16 INK4A treatment in latently infected cell lines and the non-toxic effect of the same treatment in corresponding uninfected cell lines.",[],[],Background
"To begin the identification of unique serum proteins, we obtained 18 subject serum samples: six LTNP, six HIV-1 infected subjects receiving HAART therapy (HAART) and six HIV-uninfected individuals through the Washington DC site of the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Georgetown site (Table 1) . WIHS is an NIH multicenter study of the natural history of HIV-1 infection in women [29] . LTNPs are defined by WIHS as being HIV-1 infected, but disease free for at least five years, having a CD4 count of greater than 500 at all visits and having no history of anti-retroviral therapy. The difficulty associated with analyzing serum is the presence of a high abundance of proteins which mask potential low abundance biomarkers. To overcome this obstacle, we utilized the ProteomeLab IgY serum depletion kit which removes 12 of the most abundant proteins in serum: albumin, IgG, transferrin, fibrinogen, IgA, α2-macroglobulin, IgM, α1antitrypsin, haptoglobin, α1-acid glycoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I, and apolipoprotein A-II. As can be observed in Figure 1A , whole serum (lanes 2, 3) contains many proteins and is too complex to allow for confident identification of specific proteins. However, when the high abundant proteins (Figure 1 , lanes 8, 9) are removed, lower abundant proteins that were originally masked ( Figure 1 , lanes 4, 5) are able to be analyzed. Along these lines, we found the ProteomeLab IgY serum depletion kit to be the most appropriate and reproducible manner in which to fractionate our serum samples into high and low abundant fractions. We applied this depletion strategy to pooled patient samples, combining equal volumes of whole serum from each of the six patients per sample set (LTNP, HAART, and Negative), which were subsequently depleted into low and high abundance fractions. We began the analysis with pooled samples to assist in the identification of HIV-1 infection specific protein identification as opposed to identifying individual patient and serum variability. These pooled samples were separated based on 1D SDS-PAGE ( Figure 1B ) and comparisons between LTNP, HAART, and Negative low abundant samples were carried out via in-gel trypsin digestion, peptide elution and desalting, followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as indicated by numbered arrows marking excised bands. The subsequent protein identifications served as a preliminary indication of differentially expressed proteins between the three patient types. These observations, as summarized in Table 2 , provide an insight into the relevance of proteins identified in the context of the state of HIV-1 infection. Of particular interest in Table 2 is the identification of HIV-1 enhancer binding protein 1, (HIVEP1), Ribonuclease III, and heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein in the low abundance LTNP fraction. HIVEP1 is a member of the ZAS family of proteins which bind the promoter and enhancer regions of both cellular genes and infectious viruses, including HIV-1. Also known as PRDII-BF1 or MBP-1, this transcription factor binds to both the NF-κB and the TAR transactivation response DNA elements on the HIV-1 LTR in both the presence and absence of HIV-1 Tat [30, 31] . It is not surprising that a transcription factor such as HIVEP1 would be present during HIV-1 infection; however, the identification of this protein is not necessarily a marker for a LTNP phenotype. Ribonuclease III, or Drosha, is a cellular enzyme found in the nucleus which serves to cleave double-stranded RNA hairpin transcripts as a key step in the production of miRNAs in the RNA interference pathway. Interestingly, heterochromatin protein 1, or HP1 is a member of the chromatin remodeling family of proteins, which can bind histones at methylated lysine residues and can interact with many chromatin-associated nonhistone proteins. The HP1 family of proteins has been associated with promoting a heterochromatic cellular state, where latently HIV-1 infected cells can persist as a transcriptionally silent provirus [32, 33] . It may be of interest that an HP1 binding protein would be present in the serum of an HIV-1 infected patient as HP1, including its subtypes α, β, and γ, could be involved in the control of various stages of infection. It is possible that the association of this HP1 binding protein with varying subtype of HP1 could explain the differences in patient phenotypes, especially those that result in an altered susceptibility to viral infection.","[{'start': 384, 'end': 388, 'text': '[29]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF28'}, {'start': 1247, 'end': 1249, 'text': '8,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF7'}, {'start': 1250, 'end': 1252, 'text': '9)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF8'}, {'start': 3180, 'end': 3184, 'text': '[30,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF29'}, {'start': 3185, 'end': 3188, 'text': '31]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF30'}, {'start': 4014, 'end': 4018, 'text': '[32,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF31'}, {'start': 4019, 'end': 4022, 'text': '33]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF32'}]","[{'start': 288, 'end': 297, 'text': '(Table 1)', 'ref_id': 'TABREF0'}, {'start': 1049, 'end': 1058, 'text': 'Figure 1A', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF0'}, {'start': 1229, 'end': 1238, 'text': '(Figure 1', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF0'}, {'start': 1320, 'end': 1328, 'text': 'Figure 1', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF0'}, {'start': 2066, 'end': 2075, 'text': 'Figure 1B', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF0'}, {'start': 2503, 'end': 2510, 'text': 'Table 2', 'ref_id': 'TABREF1'}, {'start': 2648, 'end': 2655, 'text': 'Table 2', 'ref_id': 'TABREF1'}]",Depletion of the 12 highly abundant serum proteins allows for the identification of low abundant proteins
"Following the initial 1D separation and MALDI-TOF MS assisted identification, the pooled patient samples were subjected to 2D-gel electrophoresis (2DGE); isoelectric focusing (IEF) using IPG strips with a pH 3.0-10.0 range followed by SDS-PAGE using 4-20% Tris-Glycine Criterion gels. The method of 2D-gel electrophoresis is much more sensitive than 1D-gel electrophoresis in that it provides separation of a complex mixture of proteins in two dimensions, therefore removing the complexity associated with overlapping proteins, or masking due to posttranslational modifications. 2DGE is a more sensitive front-end purification approach to the isolation and identification of individual protein species by mass spectrometry. Figure 2 depicts the LTNP, HAART, and Negative low abundance fractions in gels ""a"", ""b"", and ""c"", respectively, as well as the LTNP, HAART, and Negative high abundance fractions in gels ""d"", ""e"", and ""f"", respectively. Indicated protein spots from all gels were excised based on a comparison of protein abundance and the presence of unique spots in a given patient set, were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. It is important to note that although gels ""d,"" ""e,"" and ""f"" contain the majority of the high abundance proteins, unique small protein spots can still be visualized on these gels. This indicates that not only will these high abundant proteins mask proteins of interest; they can also interact with and seclude lower abundance proteins from being identified. Peak lists from the collected mass spectra were processed via peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) analysis using the Mascot and ProFound databases, compared, and compiled into a nonexhaustive list of identified proteins as displayed in Table  3 . Of particular interest are those proteins identified from gel ""a"" indicating unique low abundance proteins in the serum of LTNP patients: Tropomyosin 3, protein kinase 3, and cdk4/6 binding protein p16. Tropomyosin interacts with actin filaments to provide stability and regulates other actin binding proteins. This family of proteins has been shown to be cleaved by HIV-1 protease in vitro, resulting in the dissociation of critical cytoskeletal elements, which may demonstrate the alteration of muscle structure in the presence of an HIV-1 infection [34] . Protein kinase 3, or Protein kinase C (PKC) is a member of the family of serine/threonine kinases that are integrally involved in key cellular signaling pathways and can phosphorylate a wide variety of substrates. Not surprisingly, HIV-1 infection alters the PKC phosphorylation pathway to stimulate TNF-α production by monocytes as well as other cytokines and growth factors such as IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . PKC has also been shown to be necessary for HIV-1 Tat-mediated transactivation as well as directly phosphorylating Tat at serine 46 [40, 41] and plays an integral role in the signaling and secretion of cytokines in response to HIV-1 envelope proteins gp120, gp160, and gp41 [42, 43] . Of particular interest in the low abundance, LTNP fraction is the presence of the cdk4/ cdk6 binding protein p16, or more specifically, p16 INK4A , a member of the inhibitor of kinase 4/alternative reading frame (INK4/ARF) family of endogenous cdk (cyclindependent kinase) inhibitors [44] . Dysregulation of the cell cycle, including the manipulation of cdks and their associated Cyclins is often a hallmark of cancerous and infectious phenotypes. Indeed HIV-1 and its associated proteins have been known to alter the phosphorylation state and activity of these kinases. P16 INK4A inhibits the phosphorylation of Rb by competitively inhibiting the association of cdk4/Cyclin D therefore inhibiting the release of Rb-bound proteins, such as E2F, and the subsequent progression into the S phase of the cell cycle [44, 45] . This small molecular weight protein is an attractive candidate for a secreted, differentially expressed protein in response to HIV-1 infection. In addition to these low abundant protein identifications, the LTNP high abundant samples (gel ""d"") indicated the presence of the FGFR1 oncogenic partner and PCTAIRE protein kinase 3 as well as an anti-HIV-1 gp120 IgG 16 cκ light chain. FGFR1 oncogene partnered with the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is thought to be associated with myeloproliferative disorders and as of yet is not associated with any HIV-1 protein interactions or associated disease phenotypes. PCTAIRE protein kinase 3, however, is a member of the serine/threonine family of protein kinases and more specifically, the cdc2/cdkx subfamily that plays a role in broad signal transduction pathways. This serine/threonine kinase family member has also been associated with the essential regulation of cell cycle progression, as well as transcription and DNA repair [46] . This protein identification again demonstrates the role that HIV-1 infection plays in the dysregulation of cellular kinases and specifically, cell cycle progression.","[{'start': 2345, 'end': 2349, 'text': '[34]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF33'}, {'start': 2759, 'end': 2763, 'text': '[35]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF34'}, {'start': 2764, 'end': 2768, 'text': '[36]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF35'}, {'start': 2769, 'end': 2773, 'text': '[37]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF36'}, {'start': 2774, 'end': 2778, 'text': '[38]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF37'}, {'start': 2779, 'end': 2783, 'text': '[39]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF38'}, {'start': 2918, 'end': 2922, 'text': '[40,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF39'}, {'start': 2923, 'end': 2926, 'text': '41]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF40'}, {'start': 3060, 'end': 3064, 'text': '[42,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF41'}, {'start': 3065, 'end': 3068, 'text': '43]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF42'}, {'start': 3355, 'end': 3359, 'text': '[44]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF43'}, {'start': 3882, 'end': 3886, 'text': '[44,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF43'}, {'start': 3887, 'end': 3890, 'text': '45]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF44'}, {'start': 4882, 'end': 4886, 'text': '[46]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF45'}]","[{'start': 724, 'end': 732, 'text': 'Figure 2', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF2'}, {'start': 1782, 'end': 1790, 'text': 'Table  3', 'ref_id': 'TABREF3'}]","2DGE and MALDI-TOF analysis of pooled, depleted serum samples identified unique low abundance proteins"
"The HAART responder patient samples (gels ""b"" and ""e"") also contained unique protein candidates: serine/ threonine kinase 33, the Kelch repeat domain containing protein 11, and the SNW1 protein/APAF1 interacting protein in the low abundant fraction as well as the pre-Bcell leukemia homeobox interacting protein 1 in the high abundant fraction. Of functional interest is the general serine/threonine kinase 33 as we have already identified several cellular kinases of the same family. Additionally, the SNW1 protein is a transcriptional coactivator that induces the expression of vitamin D, retinoic acid, estrogen, and glucocorticoid associated genes. SNW1/SKIP interacts with HIV-1 Tat through the association with p-TEFb (cdk9/Cyclin T1) at the TAR RNA complex, stimulating HIV-1 transcription elongation [44] . Interestingly, some of the protein spots identified the presence of serum albumin contamination (spots a2, d5, d7, and e2), which both served as an internal positive control for mass spectrometry and also indicated that the depletion columns are not completely efficient at removing contaminating high abundant proteins.","[{'start': 808, 'end': 812, 'text': '[44]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF43'}]",[],"2DGE and MALDI-TOF analysis of pooled, depleted serum samples identified unique low abundance proteins"
"In order to further confirm the presence of these proteins in the serum as identified by mass spectrometry, we performed western blots on the same low and high abundant pooled fractions ( Figure 3A ). P16 INK4A is present in both the low and high abundant fractions of the pooled LTNPs (lanes 3, 4) and is also observed in the high abundance fraction of uninfected patients ( Figure 3A , lane 2). Interestingly, this protein is not present in HAART patient samples at all ( Figure 3A , lane 5, 6). The presence of this protein in serum may be specific to individuals that confer resistance to chronic HIV-1 infection. As p16 INK4A is an inhibitor of cell cycle kinases, in particular cdk4 and cdk6, the levels of cdk4 in the serum samples was assayed and was shown to be ubiquitously expressed across all low and high abundance serum samples ( Figure 3A , third panel from top). Indeed, levels of cdk6 were not detectable in any of the patient serum samples as compared to a 293T whole cell extract positive control (data not shown).",[],"[{'start': 188, 'end': 197, 'text': 'Figure 3A', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF4'}, {'start': 376, 'end': 385, 'text': 'Figure 3A', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF4'}, {'start': 474, 'end': 483, 'text': 'Figure 3A', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF4'}, {'start': 844, 'end': 853, 'text': 'Figure 3A', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF4'}]",Validation of MS protein identifications by Western Blot
"This implies that the presence of cdk4 in the serum is not dependent on the presence or absence of p16 INK4A and likewise, p16 INK4A does not affect the expression levels of cdk4 amongst the patient serum samples. The HP1 binding protein was initially identified in the 1D/mass spectrometry analysis in the LTNP low abundance fraction, therefore the serum levels of both HP1α and HP1γ subunits were assayed ( Figure 3A ). The family of heterochromatin-associated proteins exist as three distinct isoforms, α, β, and γ and all act as regulators of heterochromatinmediated transcriptional silencing [47] . HP1α has been shown to directly interact with DNA methyltransferases and histone methyltransferases to mediate transcriptional silencing [48, 49] and HP1γ, in particular, interacts with the histone methyltransferase Suv39H1 to initiate a chromatin-mediated repressive state of the HIV-1 integrated virus [50] . HP1α was shown to be present in the low abundance fractions of all of the patient phenotypes whereas HP1γ was shown to be present in both the low and high abundant fractions across all patient types (Fig-ure 3A ). HP1γ is observed in lower amounts in both the Negative and HAART high abundance fractions and all serum samples indicate the presence of a post-translational modification (i.e. a doublet band) as compared to the 293T whole cell extract positive control. This indicates that the HP1γ found in serum exists in both a modified and unmodified form. Interestingly, PCTAIRE was present in the highest abundance in the uninfected (Negative), high abundance fraction ( Figure 3A , lane 2), however low levels were also seen in both LTNP and HAART high abundance fractions ( Figure 3A , lane 4, 6). PCTAIRE was identified initially by mass spectrometry in the high abundance LTNP sample and can be seen in the high abundance fractions of all three of the patient types biochemically, however it is present in lower amounts in the HIV-1 infected patients, indicating that this kinase may be differentially expressed upon infection though not necessarily a unique identifier for infection. P16 INK4A is the only protein identified from mass spectrometric analysis and confirmed biochemically that is specific for the 5) were collected as the flowthrough, the column was washed (lanes 6, 7) and the high abundant proteins eluted (lanes 8, 9) . Briefly the observed high abundant proteins were compared to the known sizes of the expected proteins as indicated. B) Equal volumes of serum from each of the six patients within each category (LTNP, HAART, and Negative) were pooled together to create a stock of each condition, independent of patient-to-patient variability. Twenty microliters of each stock was subjected to depletion and equal concentration of Low and High fraction were run on a 1D gel. Lanes 2, 3 and 4 are the low abundance fractions of the pooled LTNP, HAART, and Negative patients, respectively. Lanes 6, 8, and 10 are the high abundance fractions of the pooled LTNP, HAART, and Negative patients, respectively. The indicated arrows represent differentially expressed proteins that were excised, trypsinized, and identified using MALDI-TOF for preliminary protein screening. low abundance LTNP serum samples; although the protein is also identified in the uninfected and the high abundance LTNP fractions. These results are also interesting due to the involvement of p16 INK4A in alterations of cell cycle control, additionally, mutations in p16 INK4A are found in various cancers including pancreatic, lymphomas, and sarcomas, contributing to cancer progression [45] . These findings also indicate a difference in composition of serum proteins present in HIV-1 infected individuals undergoing HAART treatment versus those that are naturally non-progressing. In order to address the concern that the protein signature of the pooled set of samples for each patient type may not be an accurate representation of the individual variability that could be present, we screened the low abundance fractions of the LTNPs for the presence of both p16 INK4A and cdk4. Results in Figure 3B indicate the lack of detection of p16 INK4A in any of the low abundant LTNP samples, especially as compared to the pooled sample ""A"" (lane 2). In contrast, p16 INK4A was detectable in LTNP patients 1 and 2, as well as in the pooled sample ""D"" for the corresponding high abundance fractions (lanes 2, 3, 4) . Due to the nature of the depletion step based on immuno-affinity, it is not surprising that p16 INK4A is detectable in individual high abundant samples, as it is probably coupled to a larger, more abundant protein and was not efficiently depleted. Additionally, post-depletion, the low abundant fractions for each patient were very dilute and the protein levels were undetectable by traditional methods. Cdk4 was detectable in the LTNP low abundant individual samples with variable abundance, correlating with the data in Figure 3A . Interestingly, cdk4 was not detectable in the LTNP high abundant individual samples, indicating that this protein was effectively isolated away from the high abundant proteins. Although through a straight western blot, the levels of p16 INK4A were undetectable, Figure 3C indicates that p16 INK4A can indeed be immunoprecipitated out of the individual low abundant LTNP samples and subsequently detected by western blot.

"Although we have identified p16 INK4A as differentially present in the serum of HIV-1 infected LTNPs as compared to HAART treated individuals, this may not directly correlate to viral pathogenesis or functionality of this protein. In order to gain insight into the reason why p16 INK4A may be present preferentially in the serum of LTNP patients, we treated latently infected HIV-1 cell lines (J1.1 and U1) with exogenous purified GST-p16 INK4A Figure 4A depicts an RT assay which measures the viral reverse transcriptase activity of infected cells and is an indicator of functional particle production. In the presence of both 0.1 and 0.5 ug of GST-p16 INK4A , J1.1 latently infected T-cells exhibited a decrease in RT activity (cpm) whereas the higher concentration of GST-p16 INK4A was able to elicit a decrease in RT activity in the latently infected monocytes, U1, as compared to the GST treatment alone. This data suggests that the presence of p16 INK4A in serum may result in a decrease in viral replication, which may help to explain why the presence of p16 INK4A in the serum of LTNPs could correlate with an overall lack of viral activity.",[],"[{'start': 445, 'end': 454, 'text': 'Figure 4A', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF6'}]",RT activity of HIV-1 infected cells decreases in vitro in the presence of exogenous p16 INK4A

We next performed western blots on whole cell extracts from all four of these uninfected cell lines and observed only Jurkat cells exhibiting an endogenous expression of p16 INK4A ( Figure 4D, lane 2) . This suggests that the decrease in cellular viability seen in Jurkat cells ( Figure 4B ) treated with p16 INK4A can be correlated with the expression of exogenous p16 INK4A in these cells, resulting in an increase in cdk4,6/Cyclin D inhibition and an increase in apoptosis.

"P16 INK4A is a critical member of the Rb tumor-suppressor pathway which acts to arrest the cell-cycle at G1/S by inhibiting the binding of cdk4/6 to Cyclin D1 and subsequently inhibiting the phosphorylation of Rb. In Figure  4C , we investigate the levels of Rb present in Jurkat cells alone (lane 1) compared to Jurkat cells treated with an excess of GST or GST-p16 INK4A (2.5 μg, lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, upon treatment of exogenous GST-p16 INK4A , we observed a decrease in cellular levels of Rb; indeed there is also a decrease in Rb with GST treatment alone The Rb antibody used detects total Rb levels in the cell, therefore we could not assume a loss of phosphorylation due to the inhibitory effect of p16 INK4A on cdk4/6. A recent paper has addressed the literature-wide discrepancies of RB dephosphorylation vs. degradation in response to drug treatment or cell senescence in various cell types [51] . It is possible that the increased amount of p16 INK4A present in these cells has induced a proteasomal degradation of Rb that has not otherwise been characterized in T cells. The cell line panel in Figure 4D was also screened for the presence of endogenous levels of Rb in these cell lines, and interestingly there is a high degree of variability. The T cell lines CEM, Jurkat, and the HIV-1 infected J1.1 have the highest endogenous levels of Rb. Interestingly, the monocytic cell lines U937 and the HIV-1 infected U1 have the lowest amount of Rb present, with almost completely undetectable levels in HIV-1 infected U1 cells. The variability supports the discrepancies seen in the literature about hypo-, hyper-phosphorylation of Rb, as well as depletion or degradation of Rb during cell cycle or cellular responses.","[{'start': 910, 'end': 914, 'text': '[51]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF50'}]","[{'start': 217, 'end': 227, 'text': 'Figure  4C', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF6'}, {'start': 1115, 'end': 1124, 'text': 'Figure 4D', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF6'}]",Cellular Rb levels decrease as a result of the exogenous addition of p16 INK4A to Jurkat T cells

"In order to confirm that the cellular effects shown in Figure 4 are specific to the natural biological activity of p16 INK4A as a cdk4/6/Cyclin D inhibitor, we attempted to mimic these studies with the small molecule compound inhibitor Fascaplysin. Fascaplysin (FASC) is a naturally derived molecule isolated from a marine sponge which specifically inhibits the interaction between cdk4/Cyclin D at an IC 50 of approximately 0.35 μM, and to a lesser extent cdk6/Cyclin D by binding the ATP pocket of cdk4, resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1/S [52, 53] . Again, we treated latently infected HIV-1 cell lines (J1.1 and U1) with three concentrations of FASC (100 nM, 500 nM, and 1 μM) and collected supernatants at 24, 48, and 72 hours post treatment. The RT activity of both J1.1 and U1 cells in the presence of FASC decreased over time with increasing concentration of the drug. This indicates that the presence of a general cdk4/Cyclin D inhibitor is able Correlating with the viability assay presented in Figure  4B , approximately 50% of Jurkat cells were killed due to additional cdk4/Cyclin D inhibition by 1 μM of FASC treatment. None of the other cell lines exhibit appreciable cell death which indicates that the drug treatment itself is not toxic to the cells. In Figure 5C , we investigate the levels of Rb present in Jurkat cells alone (lane 1) compared to Jurkat cells that have been treated with three concentrations of FASC (lanes 3, 4, and 5). Again, correlating with our exogenous p16 INK4A treatment data in Figure 4 , we observed a decrease in total cellular Rb levels at the highest concentration of FASC. This set of data confirms that the cellular effects we observed with exogenous p16 INK4A may be due to the specific cdk inhibitory activity of this molecule. It is interesting to note that these effects are seen with simple protein treatment of the cells with a purified molecule which may not have efficient entry as compared to transfection or drug treatment.

"The global proteomic analysis of serum proteins is not without its challenges; however the presence or absence of proteins in such bodily fluids of patients is often the most accurate reflection of cellular leakage or secretion of proteins in response to a disease state. Unfortunately, the classical serum proteome contains a large concentration of high abundance proteins that mask the individual proteins that are unique to a particular phenotype. The identification of such low abundance serum proteins is attractive as a method of early detection of a disease state or a response to infection. Here, we demonstrate that the detection of unique proteins in the serum of HIV-1 infected long-term non-progressors may be indicative of a natural ""immunity"" to the progression of HIV-1 infection. Specifically, we have identified p16 INK4A , a cdk4/6 inhibitor, as preferentially present in pooled serum of HIV-1 LTNP patients, as opposed to HIV-1 infected individuals responding to HAART treatment. P16 INK4A is a member of the INK4/ARF family of endogenous cdki's that serve to regulate cell cycle progression through the inhibition of specific cdk/Cyclin interactions. P16 INK4A is a critical member of the Rb/p16 tumor-suppressor pathway which inhibits the activation of cdk4/6, preventing the progression through the cell cycle. This tumor-suppressive pathway is mutated in close to 100% of human cancers and specific loss-of-function mutations are found within the Rb gene or the CDKN2A gene encoding p16 INK4A [54] . In addition to the direct inactivation of these two proteins, cancer cells also override this regulatory pathway by overexpressing cdk/ Cyclins as well as inducing the endogenous loss of expression of other cdk inhibitors. The loss of p16 INK4A results in the constitutive activation of cdk4/6 as well as pRb hyperphosphorylation, therefore bypassing the antioncogenic senescence induced by this cdk inhibitor. In addition to necessitating an oncogenic state, the regulation and manipulation of cellular cdks and Cyclins is also critical for an active HIV-1 viral infection and occurs mainly through the HIV-1 transactivator Tat. Tat interacts with the cdk2/Cyclin E complex to phosphorylate cdk7 and assist in the phosphorylation of the C-terminal Domain (CTD) of RNA Pol II at the viral LTR (long-terminal repeat) to promote viral transcription [55] [56] [57] . Cdk2 is also involved in the direct phosphorylation of Tat at both serine 16 and 46, which are critical for efficient Tat activity [56, 57] . HIV-1 transactivation is also heavily dependent on the recruitment of the cdk9/Cyclin T1 complex to the viral TAR element where it also assists in the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA Pol II as well as an autophosphorylation event which is important for the localization to the nucleus [58] . Taking into consideration the recruitment of cellular kinases for HIV-1 transcription, it is not surprising that pharmacological cdk inhibitors have been developed (analogous to endogenous cdki's) as a template to specifically inhibit these kinases. Therefore, the presence of the cdk inhibitor p16 INK4A in LTNP serum is suggestive of an existing defense mechanism in these patients that imparts a predisposition to a lack of HIV-1 disease progression.","[{'start': 1516, 'end': 1520, 'text': '[54]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF53'}, {'start': 2370, 'end': 2374, 'text': '[55]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF54'}, {'start': 2375, 'end': 2379, 'text': '[56]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF55'}, {'start': 2380, 'end': 2384, 'text': '[57]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF56'}, {'start': 2518, 'end': 2522, 'text': '[56,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF55'}, {'start': 2523, 'end': 2526, 'text': '57]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF56'}, {'start': 2816, 'end': 2820, 'text': '[58]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF57'}]",[],Discussion
"The development of pharmacological cdki's and peptide mimetics is a commonly used approach for both cancer and viral therapeutics. For instance, p16 INK4A peptides have previously been developed, which, when conjugated to localization proteins/peptides, were able to block cell cycle progression in breast cancer and colon cancer cell lines in vitro as well as reduce tumor size in an in vivo mouse model of pancreatic cancer [59] [60] [61] . These peptides have also been used for intracellular delivery to leukemia and lymphoma derived cells [59, 62] . These studies have demonstrated the ability of cdki-derived peptides to be used for both direct cell cycle arrest and the treatment of metastatic cancers. This type of therapy is an appropriate approach to cancerous states where the oncogenic mutation results in a loss of function or expression of the p16 INK4A In this study we also chose to reinforce the p16 INK4Ainduced cdki effects seen on cellular viability and viral replication with a known cdk4/6/Cyclin D inhibitor, Fascaplysin. We show that treatment of Jurkat cells with this inhibitor also results in a decrease in cellular viability, consistent with the effect seen by treatment with endogenous p16 INK4A . Additionally, the treatment of both stably infected HIV-1 cell lines, J1.1 and U1, with Fascaplysin resulted in a decrease in viral replication with a minimal decrease in cellular viability. The correlation of this pharmacological cdki inhibitor data with the functional-cdki p16 INK4A data suggests that the preferential inhibition of the cdk4/6/Cyclin D interaction by LTNPs may contribute to this phenotype.","[{'start': 426, 'end': 430, 'text': '[59]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF58'}, {'start': 431, 'end': 435, 'text': '[60]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF59'}, {'start': 436, 'end': 440, 'text': '[61]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF60'}, {'start': 544, 'end': 548, 'text': '[59,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF58'}, {'start': 549, 'end': 552, 'text': '62]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF61'}, {'start': 862, 'end': 867, 'text': 'INK4A', 'ref_id': None}]",[],Discussion
"The high and low abundance fractions analyzed for each of the three patient types were a pooled representation of six individual patient samples that almost certainly have inherent variability. Indeed, when assaying for p16 INK4A in high and low abundance serum fractions for each individual LTNP patient, p16 INK4A was present in only a subset of the patients analyzed. This indicates that although p16 INK4A may serve as a unique serum protein indicating a LTNP HIV-1 infected status, individual person-to-person changes will alter the serum proteome profile and needs to be taken into consideration. Differences in expression of p16 INK4A can be due to either a host cellular response to the infection or from an influence of the infection itself. Two different scenarios need to be Finally, many complicating factors can contribute to the altered state of proteins present in the serum, not the least of which is the length of time in which the patient has been infected, age, gender, coinfections, and other preexisting conditions such as cancer or metabolic diseases.

"MERS-CoV has a positive single-stranded RNA (+RNA) genome of~30kb, one of the largest among +RNA viruses [4] . To support the efficient replication of its exceptionally large genome, MERS-CoV encodes two replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are proteolytically processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) [12, 13] . The nsps assemble into the membrane-associated replication-transcription complexes (RTCs), which drive viral genome replication and translation.

"It has been previously shown that +RNA viruses with genome larger than 7 kb encode helicases [16] [17] [18] . Helicases unwind DNA or RNA duplexes in an NTP hydrolysis dependent manner. They are classified into six superfamilies SF1-SF6 and participate in almost every aspect of nucleic acid metabolism [19] . Regardless of their functional diversity, helicases all contain core domains that hydrolyze NTPs. The enzymatic core is formed either by the tandem RecA-like domains within the same polypeptide chain (SF1-SF2 superfamilies) or between subunits of the functional oligomer of the helicase (SF3-SF6 superfamilies) [16] . The universal features of the RecA-like domain includes a Walker A motif forming the phosphate binding loop (P-loop), a Walker B motif coordinating magnesium and an ""arginine finger"" engaging γ-phosphate of ATP [18, 20, 21] .

"Sequence conservation analysis indicates that CoV nsp13 belongs to SF1 superfamily, including Rep, UvrD, PcrA, RecD, Pif1, Dda, Upf1-like helicases and many +RNA virus helicases [18, 23] . Nidovirus helicases share many structural features with the eukaryotic Upf1 helicase, a key factor in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in cells [24, 25] . Upf1 is a multi-domain protein comprising of an N-terminal Cys-His-rich domain (CH domain) coordinating three zinc atoms, a 1B domain with the β-barrel fold and a conserved SF1 helicase core with a 1C insert in the first RecA-like domain [24, 26] . The crystal structure of nsp10 from equine arteritis virus (EAV) of Arterovirus genus is the first high-resolution structure of nidovirus helicase. EAV nsp10 has an N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD) that is followed by the 1B and a SF1 helicase core, but it lacks the 1C insert. The ZBD of nsp10 coordinates two zinc ions by an N-terminal RING-like module and one zinc ion by a C-terminal treble-clef zinc finger. The 1B domain of nsp10 undergoes large conformational change upon substrate binding, and 1B together with the 1A and 2A domains of the helicase core form a channel that accommodates the single stranded nucleic acids. The CH domain of Upf1 mediates the binding with Upf2 [26] . Similarly, the ZBD of nsp10 harbors a putative protein interaction surface, of which the binding partner remains to be identified [25] .

"CoV helicase is one of the three evolutionary most conserved proteins in nidoviruses [27] , thus making it an important target for drug development [28] . Previous biochemical characterizations have shown that CoV nsp13 exhibits multiple enzymatic activities, which include hydrolysis of NTPs and dNTPs, unwinding of DNA and RNA duplexes with 5'-3' directionality and the RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity [29, 30] . Additionally, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP, nsp12) of CoV physically interacts with nsp13 and enhances its unwinding activity [31] . Although the molecular mechanism underlying these activities and the role of nsp13 in viral RNA synthesis are poorly understood, mutagenesis studies have identified a collection of residues important for the activity of nidovirus helicase. Disruption of the zinc binding function of 229E-CoV nsp13 or EAV nsp10 by replacing the conserved Cys/His residues at ZBD or deleting the entire zinc binding domain interfere with the ATPase activity of the helicases. Moreover, the activity of nsp10 is not complemented by providing wild-type ZBD in trans [32] . These results suggest that ZBD of nidovirus helicase modulates the ATPase/helicase activity in cis. CoVs nsp13 is essential for virus replication. ATPase/helicase deficient mutations of nsp13 (either at the zinc-binding site or the Walker A motif) can lead to the abolition of CoV replication. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) M protein and nsp13 are required for efficient replication An A335V mutation in the helicase core of nsp13 causes the attenuation of MHV replication both in vitro and in vivo [33] .","[{'start': 85, 'end': 89, 'text': '[27]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF26'}, {'start': 148, 'end': 152, 'text': '[28]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF27'}, {'start': 403, 'end': 407, 'text': '[29,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF28'}, {'start': 408, 'end': 411, 'text': '30]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF29'}, {'start': 550, 'end': 554, 'text': '[31]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF30'}, {'start': 1103, 'end': 1107, 'text': '[32]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF31'}, {'start': 1611, 'end': 1615, 'text': '[33]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF32'}]",[],Introduction

"To investigate the structure of nsp13, we overexpressed the full-length MERS-CoV nsp13 (1-598aa) in High-5 insect cells (Fig 1A) . To verify that the recombinant protein is enzymatically active we first performed ATPase assay. The purified nsp13 exhibited ATPase activity with a turnover number (k cat ) of 2.03 ±0.1 s -1 and the catalytic efficiency (k cat K m -1 ) of 0.32 μM -1 s -1 (Fig 1B) . The ATPase activity of MERS-CoV nsp13 is comparable with that reported for SARS nsp13 [29] . Next, we assessed helicase activity of the recombinant nsp13. Partial RNA duplex containing 5' overhang was fully unwound by the purified nsp13. By contrast, MERS-CoV nsp13 could not unwind RNA duplex containing 3' overhang (the duplex region remained the same as the RNA duplex with 5' overhang). These results confirm that MERS-CoV nsp13 is a unidirectional helicase with the unwinding polarity of 5'-to-3' (Fig 1C, left) . Mutant with E375Q within Walker B failed to unwind the RNA substrate with 5' overhang clearly indicating that the helicase activity of MERS-CoV nsp13 is dependent on ATP hydrolysis (Fig 1C, left) . MERS-CoV nsp13 was able to hydrolyze different NTPs and dNTPs to support the unwinding of RNA substrate, with a clear preference towards ATP (Fig 1C, right) .

"Our crystallization trials with the unliganded MERS-CoV nsp13 yielded crystal, which diffracted the X-rays poorly. Intriguingly, incubation with a 5'-triphosphate-15T DNA (ppp-15T) greatly improved diffracting power of nsp13 crystals. Benefiting from the presence of an N-terminal zinc-binding domain, we collected highly redundant multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data at the zinc absorption edge and subsequently solved the structure. Next, we collected a 3.0Å resolution native dataset, which we used for final structure refinement and further analysis. There are two nsp13 in the asymmetric unit (ASU) with three zinc ions bound to each N-terminal Cys/His rich domain. Unexpectedly, no additional electron density for ppp-15T DNA could be identified, indicating that a stable nsp13-DNA complex did not form. The final model of nsp13 has good stereochemistry quality.

"MERS-CoV nsp13 is composed of multiple functional domains (Fig 2, S1 and S2 Figs). The Nterminal CH domain has 15 conserved Cys/His residues, twelve of which participate in the coordination of three zinc ions ( Fig 3A & Fig 4A-4C ). The C-terminal helicase belongs to the SF1 helicase family and consists of two ""RecA-like"" domains, referred to as RecA1 and RecA2. The CH and helicase are connected via a region consisting two additional domains. A helical domain sandwiched between the CH and RecA1 domains is followed by a six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel domain. Because of the structural resemblance to the domains of Upf1 helicases, these domains were named as Stalk and 1B, respectively. We compared the crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13 with all structures in Protein Data Bank using Dali server. The top hits were human Upf1 helicase [24] (hUpf1 PDB code: 2GK7; Dali Z-score: 22.7) and arterivirus (EAV) helicase [25] (PDB code: 4N0N; Dali Z-score: 22.2).

"The CH domain of MERS-CoV nsp13 (residues 1-112) is a compact domain with three zincbinding motifs stabilizing the fold ( Fig 3A) . The CH domain contains an N-terminal RINGlike module (1-46aa, β1-5 and α1) with two zinc fingers and C-terminal RING-like module with single treble-clef zinc finger (47-87aa, β6-8). A long loop (88-100aa, between β8-α2) spanning across the entire height of CH domain connects zinc coordination modules. The first zinc (Zn1) is coordinated within a CCCC type treble-clef zinc finger with four cysteine ligands (Cys5, Cys8 Cys26 and Cys29) ( Fig 3B) . Cys5 and Cys8 are located on a zinc knuckle between β1-β2 strands, whereas Cys26 and Cys29 are placed in the N-terminal region of α1 helix. The second zinc (Zn2) is coordinated by a two-Cys, two-His (C2H2) zinc finger motif. The cysteine ligands (Cys16 and Cys19) are forming part of a zinc knuckle between β3-β4 strands, while histidine ligands His33 and His39 are located on α1 helix and the loop between α1 and β5, respectively. The third zinc (Zn3) is coordinated by the C-terminal treble-clef zinc finger motif (Fig 3C) . A zinc-knuckle on a hairpin loop between β5 and β6 strands provides Cys50 and Cys55 for Zn3 coordination, whereas Cys72 from the C-terminal region of β7 strand and His75 from the loop between β7 and β8 strands provide two more ligands for the zinc.

The model shows that while the 3' end of single-stranded RNA is located in the channel formed by 1B, Stalk and RecA1 domains; the 5' end of the RNA lies on top of RecA2 domain (Fig 6A) . Although the helical insertion equivalent to the Upf1 1C domain is missing in nsp13, the protein has a topologically equivalent loop between β17 and β18 which fulfills similar function in RNA binding. The β17-β18-loop makes direct contacts with 1B domain, forming the 3' end outlet of the putative RNA binding channel. The narrowest opening of the putative RNA binding channel has the width and height of 6 and 12Å, which is just enough to accept a single-stranded RNA or DNA (Fig 6B) .

"Structural comparisons of the individual domains of Upf1-like helicases using Dali server showed that the CH of MERS-CoV nsp13 is structurally closer to the CH of Upf1 than to the ZBD of EAV nsp10. In accordance with previously published results, the structure of the helicase cores is well conserved in all three Upf1-like helicases (Table 2) . However, some subtle differences could also be identified. Firstly, while the helicase cores of MERS-CoV nsp13 and Upf1 have similar size, the helicase core of EAV nsp10 is more compact. MERS-CoV nsp13 contains seven and five parallel β-strands in RecA1 and RecA2 domains, respectively, Upf1 has seven and six β-strands in the RecA1 and RecA2 domain, respectively, whereas EAV nsp10 has only five and four β-strands in the RecA like domains. Secondly, while three Upf1 like helicases all contain the 1B domain with the β-barrel fold, only Upf1 has a helical 1C insertion in RecA1 domain. The equivalent 1C insertion is missing in both EAV nsp10 [25] and MERS-CoV nsp13 (Fig 4D and 4E) . Thirdly, CoVs nsp13 does not contain a C-terminal domain homologous to the C-terminal portion of EAV nsp10 (C-terminal 65 residues), which was shown to regulate ATPase and helicase activities [25] . The sequence conservation analysis showed that the C-terminal domain of arteriviruses and CoVs is indeed poorly conserved [25] . Our crystallographic study provides the complete structure of the extreme C-terminal region of MERS-CoV nsp13, which shows that the C-terminus is an integral part of the RecA2 domain. Thus, we conclude that the C-terminal regulatory domain outside SF1 helicase core is completely missing in MERS-CoV nsp13 and other CoVs helicases. Previous mutagenesis studies of CoVs nsp13 have identified a collection of residues essential to the activity of nsp13. Because nsp13 helicase is highly conserved among CoVs, the crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13 can provide three-dimensional information to understand previous phenotypes of nsp13 mutants. It has been shown that mutations of the conserved Cys/His at ZBD of 229E-CoV nsp13 interfered with its ATPase activity [32] . Ala or Arg replacement of C5003, C5021, C5024 and H5028 abolished or reduced the ATPase activity of 229E-CoV nsp13. Our crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13 confirms that these residues, corresponding to C8, C26, C29 and H33 of MERS-CoV nsp13 (Fig 4C) are coordinating Zn1 and Zn2. The loss of ATPase activity caused by Cys/His substitutes can be attributed to the disruption of zinc-binding and the integrity of the CH domain. Unexpectedly, only C5050A mutant retained significant ATPase activity (~60%). Based on the comparison with corresponding C55 of MERS-CoV nsp13, C5050 of 229E-CoV coordinates Zn3 of the ZBD. Zn3 is the most distantly located zinc from the helicase core (6.4Å away from Zn2; Fig 1A) , and the ZBD/CH is tightly attached to the helicase core in CoV nsp13, it is therefore unsurprising that the impaired binding of Zn3 has the minimal effect on the enzymatic activity of nsp13 [32] . This hypothesis is supported by the mutagenesis study of EAV nsp10 [25, 32] , which also showed that while mutant H2414A (ligand for Zn3) retained residual ATPase/ helicase activity and wild-type-level nucleic acid binding activity, the activities of mutants C2395A (ligand for Zn1) and H2399A (ligand for Zn2) was completely abolished.","[{'start': 991, 'end': 995, 'text': '[25]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF24'}, {'start': 1225, 'end': 1229, 'text': '[25]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF24'}, {'start': 1354, 'end': 1358, 'text': '[25]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF24'}, {'start': 2121, 'end': 2125, 'text': '[32]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF31'}, {'start': 3028, 'end': 3032, 'text': '[32]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF31'}, {'start': 3102, 'end': 3106, 'text': '[25,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF24'}, {'start': 3107, 'end': 3110, 'text': '32]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF31'}]","[{'start': 334, 'end': 343, 'text': '(Table 2)', 'ref_id': 'TABREF1'}, {'start': 1015, 'end': 1030, 'text': '(Fig 4D and 4E)', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF3'}, {'start': 2370, 'end': 2378, 'text': '(Fig 4C)', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF3'}, {'start': 2828, 'end': 2835, 'text': 'Fig 1A)', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF0'}]",Discussion
"Recently, Zhang et al found that mutation A335V of MHV nsp13 led to attenuation of virus growth in cells and resulted in~30 fold reduced viral titer in the livers of infected mice [33] . Residue A335 of MHV nsp13 is highly conserved among CoVs nsp13 (S2 Fig). Based on the crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13, A335 (corresponding to A336 of MERS-CoV nsp13) is located on the β17-β18-loop, a loop interacts with the 1B domain as well as participates in the formation of RNA binding channel. Because A335 is highly exposed to the surface of nsp13, Valine replacement could increase hydrophobicity of this region. Therefore, A335V mutation may impair the function of nsp13 by destabilizing the local structure critical to RNA binding or promoting aggregation of the protein.","[{'start': 180, 'end': 184, 'text': '[33]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF32'}]","[{'start': 254, 'end': 259, 'text': 'Fig).', 'ref_id': None}]",Discussion
"In summary, our current study presents the first structural insight into the multiple functionality of the CoV nsp13. Our analyses demonstrate that while the domain organization of MERS-CoV nsp13 and EAV nsp10 is conserved, the structures of the individual domains of nsp13 are closely related to their eukaryotic equivalents in Upf1 helicase. While the interaction between the CH (or ZBD) domain and the helicase core presents the most distinctive feature differentiating nidovirus helicases from the Upf1 helicases, the high resemblance between the CH domains of MERS-CoV nsp13 and Upf1 helicases is remarkable. This structural similarity not only supports a hypothesis that nidoviruses helicase may have a Upf1-like role in posttranscriptional quality control of viral RNAs synthesis [25] , but also implies a possibility that CoV nsp13 might use its Upf1-similar CH domain to interfere with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. It has already been shown that NMD targets viral RNAs for degradation in the early phase of infection of +RNA viruses [37] . Based on the coevolution of virus and host mechanism, the viruses also develop strategies to suppress NMD. Nevertheless, whether CoV nsp13 is involved in NMD suppression requires experimental evidence. To investigate what proteins bind nsp13 through its CH domain and how do they modulate nsp13 function is important to expand our knowledge about the evolution and function of Upf1-like helicases. Finally, our results provide novel structural information essential for structure-based drug design against CoV.","[{'start': 787, 'end': 791, 'text': '[25]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF24'}, {'start': 1057, 'end': 1061, 'text': '[37]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF36'}]",[],Discussion

Bias fluctuates around 0 in each scenario, but it has more variability in the random sampling compared to other scenarios, resulting also in a higher mean value of absolute bias over the B simulations (still always lower than 0.2 %). The lower performance of the estimator in the first scenario is due to the fact that random sampling is not a convenient design in the simulated setting. In fact, in phase I cohort we expect around 90 events of type 1 (incidence of 9 % and sample size of 1000), thus if we randomly sample 100 subjects from the phase I cohort, we expect to observe only 9 events (in phase II sample). With such a small number of events, unbiasedness is in fact not sufficient to ensure a reasonable behaviour and to get enough information on event incidence. To address this issue, the other study designs (scenarios 2, 3, and 4) are indeed thought to guarantee to sample more events of type 1. Thus we recommend adopting efficient designs accounting for the event of interest. Relative and standardized biases were always lower than 6 % (data not shown).

"A study on childhood ALL evaluated the role of a genetic polymorphism (glutathione S-transferase-θ, GST-T1) on treatment failure due to relapse (in different sites), in the presence of a competing event (toxic death).

Subjects carrying the null variants fail to express the GST-T1 enzyme, that is involved in drug metabolism.

"We have derived an estimator for cumulative incidence of events based on the subdistribution hazard accounting for competing risks under a general sampling design from an infinite target population.

Confidence intervals, derived on the log scale, provided good coverage in simulations, but alternative confidence intervals might also be considered such as the complementary log-log transformation [36] . The proposed estimator was used to estimate incidence of relapse by genotype in a cohort of childhood ALL patients, where the genotype was ascertained only on a subsample of the cohort chosen by an optimal sampling approach based on relapse as the event of interest. Interestingly, we can also analyze the incidence of the competing event (toxic death) or of the combined endpoint (relapse or toxic death), but the efficiency could be lower unless the subsampling is adapted to this new endpoint by including a further strata on toxic death in the sampling process.

"In order to derive a model-based estimate of incidence (adjusted for possible covariates) two main approaches have been followed in the context of competing risk, the first one based on the cause-specific hazard inspired by Benichou and Gail [16, 42, 43] and the other one based on the subdistribution hazard [19, 44] . The crude cumulative estimator developed by Kovalchik and Pfeiffer [45] for two-phase studies for finite population follows the first approach, and the Cox model for two-phase designs [14] could be used to extend it for infinite population. Under this model we can estimate the effect of a covariate on the cause-specific hazard to address its impact on the event by an aetiological point of view. However it is well known that this does not reflect the impact of the variable on the crude cumulative incidence. The latter effect, even if affected by the incidence of the other competing events, could still be of interest for a public health prospective. Future work will concern the development of a regression model to assess the effect of a covariate on the crude cumulative incidence.

Indeed, the impaired expression of CD40 in pDCs from MS patients could impair the responsiveness to a CD40L stimulus [16] .

"Our results indicate that pDCs from MS patients are differentially activated compared to pDCs from healthy donors in response to single strand RNA mimicked by Resiquimod. Interestingly, mDCs from the same individuals and activated with the same stimulus behave similarly in MS and healthy donors. This could be explained by the downstream signaling activated by TLR-7 and TLR-8 in pDCs and mDCs, respectively [20] . Moreover, fast indirect signaling pathways could also influence pDC activation. However, these results suggest a potential differential induction of T cell immune response induced by pDCs in MS patients compared to healthy donors. For instance, it is known that a TLR-7 agonist induces lytic properties of pDCs via the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), whose expression is directly correlated with individual viral loads in HIV+ patients [21] . Similarly, pDCs express granzyme B, which mediates killing of CD4 T cell during viral infections like HIV [22, 23] . Moreover, we reported that pDCs from MS patients stimulated with Resiquimod and co-cultured with naïve T cells significantly induce the secretion of IL-9, a cytokine produced by a new Th profile called Th9 [18] . Interestingly, in a mouse model it has been demonstrated that OX40-L, a costimulatory molecule that we found highly expressed in pDCs from MS patients, contributes to IL-9 polarization [24] . Here, we found that recombinant OX40L induce and amplify IL-9 production by human T cells, indicating that the interaction OX40-OX40-L between pDCs and T cells in MS patients could be responsible of the IL-9 induction observed in MS patients. Other costimulatory molecules upregulated in pDCs from MS patients, such as HLA-DR and CD86, are considered as the predominant molecules delivering ""first and second signals"" during T-cell activation [25] . Thus, our results indicate that OX40-L could be the crucial costimulatory molecule determining the fate of the immune response generated by pDCs. In fact, OX40 and OX40-L dictate the different type of effector (protective or pathogenic) T cells that accumulate in primary and secondary responses, as well as determine the frequency of memory T cells that are generated [26] . Ligation of OX40 can induce Tfh polarization [27, 28] , an inflammatory Th2 response [29] , Th1 and Th2 [30, 31] , Th9 [24] , Th17 [32] , and T regulatory cells [33] , depending on the context.

"Moreover, OX40 signals can mediate CD8 immune responses, which is particularly relevant during viral infection. It has been demonstrated that the OX40-OX40-L axis can indirectly promote CD8 T cell priming through augmenting CD4 T cell help [35] , and directly enhances the expansion of memory CD8 T cell populations specific for viruses [36] , including EBV, which has been widely associated with MS [37, 38] . In MS, the frequency of CD8 + T cells specific for EBV lytic and latent antigens is higher in active and inactive MS patients, respectively, compared to healthy donors, underlying the importance of the activation of the anti-EBV response in MS [39] . In line with the effect of the OX40-OX40-L axis in CD8 T cell activation, OX40 agonistic therapy has proven a potent cancer immunotherapy, enhancing CD8 T cell tumor infiltration [40] . Moreover, our analysis indicated that the frequency of pDC subpopulations in the blood of MS patients does not differ significantly from that of healthy donors, according to the similar levels of CD80 and PDL-1 in pDCs from MS patients and healthy donors.

"The risk of acquiring nosocomial infections is a recognized problem in health-care facilities worldwide (Harbarth, Sax, & Gastmeier, 2003) . While the transmission routes for some diseases are well documented, the precise mode of transmission is uncertain for many infections, particularly for those pathogens that cause health-care-acquired infections (HCAIs). Although it is probable that the majority of transmission occurs via contact routes (Sax et al., 2009) , there is increasing recognition that the air plays an important role in disease spread (Li et al., 2007) . Understanding the role that ventilation airflow plays in the dispersion of infectious microorganisms is tantamount to assessing exposure to pathogens and hence infection risk.

This can be expressed in terms of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) {S(t) : t ≥ 0}, where the random variable S(t) represents the number of susceptible individuals at time t, and the aim is to compute transient probabilities p S (t) = P(S(t) = S) for any S ∈ = {0, 1, . . . , N}, where N is the number of individuals in the population.

In particular, the per capita infection rate λ k for susceptible individuals at zone k is defined as λ k = p k C k , where C k is the concentration of infectious material at zone k and p k is the pulmonary rate of these individuals. We note that this concentration could depend on the number of infected individuals, i j , in every zone 1 ≤ j ≤ M, due to airflow.

We note here that Equation (3) means considering per capita infection rates at each zone 1 ≤ j ≤ M as functions λ j (i 1 , . . . , i M ) of the number of infectives (i 1 , . . . , i M ) within each ventilation zone at the hospital ward. In Section 2.2, we now go on to exploit this, to link the zonal ventilation model with a multicompartment SI S model with detection, to evaluate the infection spread dynamics within the hospital ward until detection of the outbreak. Instead of carrying out stochastic simulations, we present an exact approach for analyzing a summary statistic of the outbreak: the total number of infections occurring until the outbreak ends or is detected and declared. This exact approach does not only allow us to compute this quantity of interest, but it also allows one to carry out a sensitivity analysis on the model parameters, so that the impact that different characteristics of the ventilation setting has on this summary statistic can be evaluated.","[{'start': 165, 'end': 189, 'text': 'Noakes and Sleigh (2009)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF18'}, {'start': 501, 'end': 525, 'text': 'Noakes and Sleigh (2009)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF18'}, {'start': 554, 'end': 576, 'text': '(Noakes & Sleigh, 2009', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF18'}]",[],A Zonal Ventilation Model for Linking Airflow Dynamics and Infection Rates

We note that ventilation setting B has no extract ventilation in zones 1b and 2b (Q o,1b = Q o,2b = 0), but it directs the airflow instead toward corridor areas. In this setting B, corridor areas have no patients and significant ventilation, with airflow unbalance from bays to corridor areas acting in practice as an infection control measure. Thus, our results suggest that the spread control ability of a given ventilation setting depends on the location of the patient starting the outbreak as well as the airflow direction. However, from results in Fig. 4 and Table IV , ventilation setting D seems to perform poorly regardless of the initial infective location, suggesting that some ventilation settings might be inadvisable regardless of this location (i.e., if this location is unknown).

This leads to the contribution M j=1 δ j i j in Equations (4) and (5).

We represent hospital ward overoccupancy by locating three additional patients at the corridor areas; in particular, we set N = 21 and locate one additional patient in each of the {c1, c2, c3} zones. This practice is common in U.K. hospitals during times of high demand.

On the other hand, when the initial infective patient is located in zone 1a, results in Table X can be compared to those in Table III for (δ −1 , β 0 ) = (12 h, 9 m 3 /min). For zone 1a, values of E[R] are larger in Table X than in Table III ; if the nosocomial outbreak is initiated by an infective patient in zone 1a, more infections during this outbreak should be expected under ward overoccupancy. This might not be only related to having more patients in the ward under overoccupancy (21 instead of 18), but also to the potential of patients in the corridor to act as infection links between bays. For example, under overoccupancy, an infective individual in zone 1a might infect individuals in bay 2 by, as a first step, infecting individuals in the corridor areas. These people then might more easily infect individuals in bay 2, before being discharged, due to being in closer proximity and depending on the particular ventilation setting in place in the ward. Infection dynamics related to the scenario above highly depend on the particular ventilation setting under study, which can be noticed by inspecting rows corresponding to zones {c1, c2, c3} in Table X . While an individual in zone 1a has a larger infectious potential (in terms of E[R]) than individuals located in the corridor when ventilation settings B and E are in place, this is not the case for ventilation settings C, D, and F, and these infectious potentials are comparable under ventilation setting A, which represents a well-mixed scenario.

Our model incorporates the possibility of considering a wide range of ventilation settings, the discharge and arrival of patients within the ward, as well as different hypotheses regarding how outbreak detection and declaration occurs. Moreover, it allows us to explore the interplay between ventilation, outbreak management, ward overoccupancy, and the location of the infective patient starting the outbreak.",[],[],DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
"Our results suggest that detection time dominates ventilation when the variable of interest is the number of infections occurring before the declaration or end of the outbreak, with longer detection times leading to significantly more infections happening. Longer detection times can arise when analyzing pathogens with long infectious asymptomatic periods, when declaration of an outbreak requires for several patients to show symptoms, or when this declaration depends on screening events for which results take longer to arrive. The interplay between ventilation of the hospital ward and location of the initially infective patient starting the outbreak implies that recommendations on where to locate potentially infected (e.g., newly admitted) patients in a given hospital ward could be issued depending on the ventilation in place in the ward. Our model also predicts that decreasing the infection spread risk in the hospital ward can sometimes come at the expense of increasing the risk in particular areas of the ward.",[],[],DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
"Similar models have already been considered in the literature for linking zonal ventilation scenarios with epidemic spread models (Carruthers et al., 2018; Ko et al., 2004; Noakes & Sleigh, 2009) , where epidemic dynamics are usually analyzed by means of stochastic simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this link is carried out by defining in detail the CTMC for the infection spread, where infection rates at each ventilation zone are in fact functions λ j (i 1 , . . . , i M ) of the number of infectives in each zone at any given time, and where (i 1 , . . . , i M ) represents in fact a state of the CTMC under study. This detailed mathematical construction allows for the analytical computation of summary statistics (such as R in this work), and for carrying out a local sensitivity analysis that allows one to identify the particular factors of each ventilation setting having the most significant impact on the infection spread.","[{'start': 130, 'end': 155, 'text': '(Carruthers et al., 2018;', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF2'}, {'start': 156, 'end': 172, 'text': 'Ko et al., 2004;', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF11'}, {'start': 173, 'end': 195, 'text': 'Noakes & Sleigh, 2009)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF18'}]",[],DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
"It should be noted that the primary objective in this study is to demonstrate this detailed mathematical analysis and how it can be applied to evaluate the relative influence of different parameters. The model is applied to a hypothetical hospital ward, which, while it is representative of multibed ward environments in many hospitals, is a very simplified model of reality. The results demonstrate that the ventilation flow settings may influence the dispersion of airborne pathogens and hence the risk of transmission; however, these should be interpreted with caution. We assume a steady-state ventilation scenario with the flow pattern replicated exactly between neighboring bays 1, 2, and 3. In reality, the flows will not be exactly identical for every bay, and other factors such as heat sources and movement of people will alter the mixing with and between zones. In particular, corridor ventilation often has a directional flow due to wider spacing of ventilation supply/extract grilles, which may hinder or improve the control of infection. However, the analysis we have carried out gives some clear insight into why particular directional flows influence risk, and the relative importance of detection strategies, ventilation control, and occupancy.",[],[],DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
"It is clear that some of our conclusions could be highly dependent on the hospital ward structure, and therefore the flexibility of our methodology comes into play. It can be applied to any hospital ward of interest by appropriately adapting the corresponding ventilation matrix V.

The aim of this is twofold: (i) to show how our methodology can be easily implemented for a different hospital ward to that in Fig. 2 by just adapting the ventilation matrix V, illustrating how this matrix varies with hospital ward structure; and (ii) to show that while some of our conclusions might be hospital ward structure dependent, others seem to be valid for a wide range of hospital ward structures (e.g., detection dominates ventilation as well in this alternative hospital ward).",[],"[{'start': 661, 'end': 667, 'text': 'Fig. 2', 'ref_id': None}]",DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
"In this article, we go beyond the SI epidemic model in Noakes and Sleigh (2009) , proposing an SIS-type model, which allows us to incorporate patients' arrival/discharge and outbreak detection and declaration. This is similar to the model recently proposed by López-García and Kypraios (2018), as a unified framework for modeling the spread of nosocomial infections. We note that this epidemic model structure would be especially relevant for pathogens with no or short (i.e., negligible compared to the average patient's LOS) noninfectious or latent periods, and where the infectious period is long enough so that recovery of patients does not occur before discharge (or detection). Depending on the hospital ward under analysis and the average LOS of patients in this ward, this could be the case for influenza or norovirus. Pathogens with nonnegligible incubation periods (e.g., 7-21 days for measles) might require more complex stochastic epidemic model structures such as the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infective-recovered). On the other hand, when analyzing hospital wards with longer average patient LOS, so that individuals may become infected and recover during their stay, SIRS-type epidemic models would be required to represent the recovery of patients (I → R) before discharge (R → S) occurs. We note here that in principle, the methodology outlined in Section 3 can be extended to any of these compartmental-based epidemic models for the disease spread dynamics, where the link between the deterministic zonal ventilation model for the airflow dynamics and the stochastic epidemic model for disease spread dynamics would still be as in Section 2. In a similar way, more complex epidemic model structures could allow one to study the infection spread dynamics after outbreak detection and declaration occurs. In this article, we have focused instead on the impact of ventilation on disease spread until the end or declaration of the outbreak. Considering these alternative compartmental-based epidemic model structures could be the aim of future work.","[{'start': 55, 'end': 79, 'text': 'Noakes and Sleigh (2009)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF18'}]",[],DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
"Finally, we note that when carrying out our analysis, the main computational effort lies in solving systems of linear equations, where the number of equations is determined by the number of states of the corresponding CTMC, given by Equation (6) in our model. Limitations of our approach are then of a computational nature, since highly complex epidemic models (here, a multicompartment SIS stochastic model with detection) linked to large hospital wards split in many different ventilation zones (here, M = 9 zones with three empty zones and six zones containing three patients each) would lead to an intractable number of equations, and stochastic simulation approaches would prevail.",[],[],DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Children residing in Bhaktapur district, but outside the municipality, were only under such passive surveillance. Children aged 2 to 35 months presenting at our study clinic were screened for fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing (LCI) and classified according to the standard World Health Organization (WHO) algorithm for acute respiratory infection (ARI) [19] (Figure 1 ). Pneumonia was defined as cough or difficult breathing combined with fast breathing, that is ≥ 50 breaths/min for children 2 to 11 months old, and ≥ 40 breaths/min for children ≥ 12 months old. Severe pneumonia was defined as cough or difficult breathing combined with LCI.

Children were weighed using a UNICEF electronic scale (SECA, Hamburg, Germany) accurate to 100 g with a mother/child-function, so the weight of the child could be determined while held by his or her mother. The child's length/height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wooden measuring board (as recumbent length in children <2 years of age and as height in children ≥ 2 years of age). Oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) was measured either on a finger or a toe with a pulse oxymeter (Siemens MicO2, Siemens Medical Systems Inc, Danvers, MA, USA) using a pediatric sensor (Nellcor, Pleasanton, CA, USA).

"As derived from the correlation analyses (r s = 0.68), up to 46% of the monthly variation in occurrence of viral infections in our study could be explained by meteorological factors.

"Despite the high sensitivity and specificity of the Hexaplex Plus assay [15] , we may have underestimated the number of viral infections. Viral load in a specimen depends on several conditions, such as time of collection in relation to onset of illness. In most of the study children, the NPA specimen was collected early in the course of illness, which increases the likelihood of detecting an infectious agent [14] . Moreover, by not including children who had taken antibiotics during the last 48 hours, we primarily recruited new cases of pneumonia. Using multiplex instead of single molecular assays may have contributed to an underestimation of the number of viral CAP cases, as some loss of sensitivity is an inherent limitation of multiplex PCR assays [13] .","[{'start': 72, 'end': 76, 'text': '[15]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF14'}, {'start': 412, 'end': 416, 'text': '[14]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF13'}, {'start': 760, 'end': 764, 'text': '[13]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF12'}]",[],Discussion
"We observed a large month-to-month variation in the proportion of CAP cases from whom we identified a res- piratory RNA virus, largely reflecting the epidemic pattern of viral infections in this sub-tropical setting. A limitation of our study was that we were not able to include more etiologic agents in our diagnostic panel. Adenovirus is among the more common viral respiratory pathogens causing LRTI in preschool children [64] . Atypical bacteria, like Mycoplasma pneumoniae, cause pneumonia more frequently in school-age children, but can also cause mild infections in younger children [65] . Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza are the main bacterial pathogens causing childhood pneumonia. However, nasopharyngeal carriage of these bacteria is frequent in healthy, young children [66] . Moreover, their detection in pneumonia is hampered by the difficulties of obtaining specimens from the lower airways and the low sensitivity of identifying these pathogens by blood culture [67] , and such invasive methods are not well suited for community settings. S. pneumoniae has been suggested to play a role in the development of virus-associated pneumonia in children in hospital, especially in cases with influenza and PIV types 1 to 3 [68] . The monthly number of cases where we did not identify any virus was particularly pronounced in the CAP epidemic that peaked in December 2005 (Figure 2) , which comprised the largest outbreaks of influenza A and B (Figure 3 ). There is abundant evidence that infection with influenza viruses predisposes for pneumococcal disease [69] . Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the cases where we detected a viral pathogen in fact had a mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia or pneumonia after acquisition of a new pneumococcal serotype during an upper respiratory viral infection. Again, quantitative PCR methods and carefully conducted casecontrol studies could shed light on the clinical importance of detecting viral pathogens in NPA specimens from children with pneumonia.","[{'start': 426, 'end': 430, 'text': '[64]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF63'}, {'start': 591, 'end': 595, 'text': '[65]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF64'}, {'start': 801, 'end': 805, 'text': '[66]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF65'}, {'start': 997, 'end': 1001, 'text': '[67]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF66'}, {'start': 1252, 'end': 1256, 'text': '[68]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF67'}, {'start': 1587, 'end': 1591, 'text': '[69]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF68'}]","[{'start': 1400, 'end': 1410, 'text': '(Figure 2)', 'ref_id': None}, {'start': 1472, 'end': 1481, 'text': '(Figure 3', 'ref_id': None}]",Discussion

"Lectins are bioactive proteins of non-immune origin that recognize diverse sugar moieties in a non-catalytic manner. These proteins have been found in a wide range of organisms in nature from viruses to animals and function as recognition molecules in many biological processes, such as host-pathogen interaction, migration of lymphocytes, and cell communication. Studies on lectins have mainly been performed for land plants and animals from the viewpoints of their physiological functions and applications as convenient tools in glycomics because of their capability to discriminate the difference in carbohydrate structures. Practically, a number of lectins have been isolated and characterized from land plants and animals, some of which are now commercially available and are even employed in clinical applications including carbohydrate profiling, blood typing, cancer diagnoses, karyotyping, and assessing the immunocompetence of patients [1] .","[{'start': 946, 'end': 949, 'text': '[1]', 'ref_id': None}]",[],Introduction

"From the powdered sample of H. renshii, lectin was extracted with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (PB) containing 0.85% NaCl (PBS) and effectively recovered as a precipitate with 70% saturation of ammonium sulfate. In hydrophobic chromatography with stepwise elution of ammonium sulfate in PB, lectin was mostly adsorbed onto a HiPrep Phenyl FF column equilibrated with 1 M ammonium sulfate and then eluted with PB ( Figure 1A) . By re-chromatography of the non-adsorbed fraction, lectin was again recovered as PB-eluate in the same way. Both PB-eluates were combined and subjected to hydrophobic chromatography on the same column with a gradient elution (1.0-0 M) of ammonium sulfate in PB, in which the lectin was adsorbed and then eluted as a broad peak with 0.55-0.15 M ammonium sulfate ( Figure 1B) . The active peak fraction gave five major peaks in successive gel-filtration on a Superdex-75 column ( Figure 1C) . A major active peak obtained by gel-filtration was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a TSKgel DEAE-5PW column, affording a sharp protein peak with activity ( Figure 1D ).

"Carbohydrate binding specificity of HRL40 was first evaluated by hemagglutination-inhibition test with sugars and glycoproteins ( Table 2 ). The hemagglutination activity (HA) of HRL40 was strongly inhibited by a few glycoproteins such as yeast mannan, porcine thyroglobulin (PTG), and asialo-PTG, all of which contain HM-glycans, but not by other glycoproteins bearing complex N-glycans and O-glycans, including transferrin, fetuin and mucin and their asialo-derivatives. All of monosaccharides and lactose examined were not inhibitory. From the results, HRL40 was suggested to have a binding preference for HM-glycans.

"HM-binding lectins have been attracting attention because they showed potent anti-viral activities by inhibiting the entry of viruses to the target host cells through binding with the viral envelope glycoproteins containing HM-glycans. We recently discovered and characterized HMbinding lectins from lower organisms, including marine algae and a blue-green alga (cyanobacterium) [6, [8] [9] [10] 12, 15] . They were strictly specific for HM-glycans and most of them have no affinity for monosaccharides, including mannose and are thermostable monomeric proteins. We demonstrated that these HM-specific lectins thus far isolated by our group can be subdivided into four families (Types I-IV) based on their primary structures and recognition modes of branched mannosides [30] . Among them, Type I lectins are specific for HMs bearing an exposed (α1-3) Man in the D2 arm, and their binding activities are remarkably decreased with those having a non-reducing terminal (α1-2) Man attached to the (α1-3) Man residue. This group includes the lectins from several red algal species, such as E. serra (ESA) [6] , K. alvarezii (KAA) [9, 12] , K. striatum (KSA) [10] and a bluegreen alga (cyanobacterium) O. agardhii (OAA) [15] . From the cDNA cloning of a cyanobacterial lectin, OAA, we presented that the genes coding Type I lectin proteins are widely distributed in lower organisms [6, 12, 29] , including red algae and bacteria such as Myxococcus xanthus hemagglutinin (MBHA) [31] , Pseudomonas fluorescens lectin (PFL) [32] and Burkholderia oklahomensis agglutinin (BOA) [33] .

"HM-binding lectins have been attracting attention because they showed potent anti-viral activities by inhibiting the entry of viruses to the target host cells through binding with the viral envelope glycoproteins containing HM-glycans. We recently discovered and characterized HM-binding lectins from lower organisms, including marine algae and a blue-green alga (cyanobacterium) [6, [8] [9] [10] 12, 15] . They were strictly specific for HM-glycans and most of them have no affinity for monosaccharides, including mannose and are thermostable monomeric proteins. We demonstrated that these HM-specific lectins thus far isolated by our group can be subdivided into four families (Types I-IV) based on their primary structures and recognition modes of branched mannosides [30] . Among them, Type I lectins are specific for HMs bearing an exposed (α1-3) Man in the D2 arm, and their binding activities are remarkably decreased with those having a non-reducing terminal (α1-2) Man attached to the (α1-3) Man residue. This group includes the lectins from several red algal species, such as E. serra (ESA) [6] , K. alvarezii (KAA) [9, 12] , K. striatum (KSA) [10] and a blue-green alga (cyanobacterium) O. agardhii (OAA) [15] . From the cDNA cloning of a cyanobacterial lectin, OAA, we presented that the genes coding Type I lectin proteins are widely distributed in lower organisms [6, 12, 29] , including red algae and bacteria such as Myxococcus xanthus hemagglutinin (MBHA) [31] , Pseudomonas fluorescens lectin (PFL) [32] and Burkholderia oklahomensis agglutinin (BOA) [33] . MBHA and PFL were confirmed to inhibit the HIV-infection in the host cells using their recombinants [34, 35] . The Type I HM-specific lectins (the OAA family) consist of two or four tandem repeats of the conserved domain of 66-67 amino acids. The crystal structures and NMR analyses indicated that the monomeric lectins of this family had the plural glycan binding sites in a polypeptide chain, in which two and four binding sites were formed by swapping between two and four tandemly repeated domains, respectively [36, 37] . The amino acid sequences were well conserved between domains as well as between the lectin species within this family [6, 12, 29] . In in silico search on GenBank database, the similar sequences have not been found in any proteins from animals, higher plants and green algae (Chlorophyta).","[{'start': 380, 'end': 383, 'text': '[6,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF5'}, {'start': 384, 'end': 387, 'text': '[8]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF7'}, {'start': 388, 'end': 391, 'text': '[9]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF8'}, {'start': 392, 'end': 396, 'text': '[10]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF9'}, {'start': 397, 'end': 400, 'text': '12,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF11'}, {'start': 401, 'end': 404, 'text': '15]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF14'}, {'start': 771, 'end': 775, 'text': '[30]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF29'}, {'start': 1101, 'end': 1104, 'text': '[6]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF5'}, {'start': 1126, 'end': 1129, 'text': '[9,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF8'}, {'start': 1130, 'end': 1133, 'text': '12]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF11'}, {'start': 1154, 'end': 1158, 'text': '[10]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF9'}, {'start': 1216, 'end': 1220, 'text': '[15]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF14'}, {'start': 1378, 'end': 1381, 'text': '[6,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF5'}, {'start': 1382, 'end': 1385, 'text': '12,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF11'}, {'start': 1386, 'end': 1389, 'text': '29]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF28'}, {'start': 1473, 'end': 1477, 'text': '[31]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF30'}, {'start': 1517, 'end': 1521, 'text': '[32]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF31'}, {'start': 1569, 'end': 1573, 'text': '[33]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF32'}, {'start': 1676, 'end': 1680, 'text': '[34,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF33'}, {'start': 1681, 'end': 1684, 'text': '35]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF34'}, {'start': 2092, 'end': 2096, 'text': '[36,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF35'}, {'start': 2097, 'end': 2100, 'text': '37]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF36'}, {'start': 2221, 'end': 2224, 'text': '[6,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF5'}, {'start': 2225, 'end': 2228, 'text': '12,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF11'}, {'start': 2229, 'end': 2232, 'text': '29]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF28'}]",[],Discussion
"In this study, we isolated an HM-specific lectin, named HRL40 from the calcareous marine alga, H. renschii, for the first time. In terms of the oligosaccharide-binding specificity, HRL40 clearly belongs to the OAA family (Type I) because this lectin strictly recognized the HM-glycans having an exposed (α1-3) Man in the D2 arm ( Figure 3) . Thus, HRL40 is the first Type I HM-specific lectin from the Chlorophyta. As seen in Figure 3 , the binding preference of HRL40 for the exposed (α1-3) Man residue was markedly severe among Type I lectin family, promising the utility of this lectin as a valuable tool in the fields of basic and applied glycomics. To be exact, HRL40 potently inhibited the entry of influenza virus (A/H3N2/Udorn/72) to NCI-H292 cells with ED 50 of 2.45 nM, which was the highest anti-influenza virus activity that we have ever examined for lectins [8, 9, 13, 35] . In addition, the affinity constant (K D , 3.69 × 10 −11 M) of this lectin for the influenza virus envelope hemagglutinin was also remarkably high. Depending on the viral strain, the influenza viral hemagglutinins contain the HM-glycan(s) in the molecule, which is/are located close to the binding site for N-acetylneuraminic acid on the surface receptor of the target host cells [23] . It is therefore supposed that HRL40 inhibited the viral entry through binding to the HM-glycan of the viral hemagglutinin.","[{'start': 871, 'end': 874, 'text': '[8,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF7'}, {'start': 875, 'end': 877, 'text': '9,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF8'}, {'start': 878, 'end': 881, 'text': '13,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF12'}, {'start': 882, 'end': 885, 'text': '35]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF34'}, {'start': 1267, 'end': 1271, 'text': '[23]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF22'}]","[{'start': 330, 'end': 339, 'text': 'Figure 3)', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF5'}, {'start': 426, 'end': 434, 'text': 'Figure 3', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF5'}]",Discussion
"Despite HRL40 showing typical carbohydrate binding profile of Type I HM-specific lectins, its molecular structure was quite different from the family. HRL40 was an SS-linked tetrameric protein containing more than 13 half-cystine residues, in contrast to other lectins of the OAA family, which are monomeric and have one or no cysteine residues in the molecule. In addition, the presence of free cysteine residues was also suggested for this lectin ( Figure S1 ). We preliminarily prepared the peptide fragments of HRL40-1 using a few kinds of protease after S-pyridylethylation under a reducing agent and checked their sequences by nanoLC-MS/MS, and detected a lot of peptide fragments containing S-pyridylethyl-modified sequences. However, the peptide fragments having the sequences similar to the OAA family were not searched out. HRL40-1 and HRL40-2 shared the identical molecular weights and the number of disulfide bonds, but nevertheless they were clearly separated by reverse-phase HPLC ( Figure 6 ). It may be possible that both isolectins may differ in spatial structure or that they may have the substitution of a few amino acids, which does not affect the molecular weights. Due to the lack of available sequence information, including N-terminal amino acids, cDNA cloning of HRL40 remains to be clarified in the future.",[],"[{'start': 451, 'end': 460, 'text': 'Figure S1', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF0'}, {'start': 997, 'end': 1005, 'text': 'Figure 6', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF13'}]",Discussion
